# Meme Generator

This web app is simply a meme generator. Once you create an account, you will have access to the generate button which then queries a database with over 3000 high quality memes taken from a Kaggle dataset (Top 10,000 Memes from Reddit). Once the query is completed you will be redirected to the address of meme itself so you can either laugh histerically, share with your friends, or download for safe keeping. Due to the innapropriate nature of some of these memes from this dataset, we have created a check box to indicate what memes you would like to see, PG or PG-13.  

## Use

Simply visit [notmonday.herokuapp](https://notmonday.herokuapp.com/) and create an account to get started, and prepare to start LOL and ROFL.
